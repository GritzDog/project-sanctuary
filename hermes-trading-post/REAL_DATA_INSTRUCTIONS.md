# Real Data Now Active!

## What I Fixed

1. **Removed fake data generation** - The app was using `SimpleChartDataFeed` which generated 7 days of fake BTC data
2. **Connected to real Coinbase API** - Now using `ChartDataFeed` which connects to:
   - **WebSocket**: `wss://ws-feed.exchange.coinbase.com` for real-time price updates
   - **REST API**: `https://api.exchange.coinbase.com` for historical candle data

## How to Test

1. Make sure the dev server is running: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
3. You should see real BTC-USD data loading

## Troubleshooting

If you see no data or errors:

1. **Test the connections directly**: Open http://localhost:5173/test-real-data.html
   - This shows raw WebSocket data and lets you test the API
   - Click "Test Coinbase API" to verify the proxy is working

2. **Check browser console** (F12) for errors like:
   - CORS errors → the Vite proxy should handle this
   - 429 errors → rate limiting from Coinbase
   - Network errors → check your internet connection

## About the Zoom

The zoom functionality is built into the ChartDataFeed and automatically adjusts granularity based on the visible time range. If you want to completely remove it, let me know and I can disable the zoom feature entirely.

## Current Data Feed Features

- **Real-time updates**: WebSocket provides live price ticks
- **Historical data**: Loads candles from Coinbase API
- **Caching**: Uses IndexedDB to cache historical data (with fallback if cache fails)
- **Auto-granularity**: Automatically switches between 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 6h, 1d based on zoom level
- **Progressive loading**: Loads data in the background to improve performance

## Latest Fixes

### IndexedDB Version Mismatch (Fixed!)
- Updated DB version from 2 to 3
- Added fallback to fetch directly from API if cache fails
- No more "VersionError" blocking everything

### Rate Limiting (Fixed!)
- Proper request queue (10/sec max)
- Automatic retries with backoff
- Shows status in console

### Period/Granularity Changes (Fixed!)
- Combined reactive statement handles both changes
- 50ms debounce prevents race conditions
- Manual granularity persists until you change it

## Quick Test

Just reload the page - it should work now! The app will:
- Try to use cache for speed
- Fall back to API if cache fails
- Show data either way
