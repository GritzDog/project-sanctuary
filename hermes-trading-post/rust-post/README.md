# BTC Trading Dashboard (egui)

This project is now a pure Rust desktop application using egui/eframe for the UI. Tauri and webview dependencies have been removed. The 3D chart component (`btc-chart`) is still launched as a native process from the dashboard.

## Features
- Real-time Bitcoin price and candle data from Coinbase WebSocket
- Launches the 3D chart as a separate process
- Console log buffer with colored log levels
- Modern, fast, and native Rust GUI (no JS, no DOM, no Tauri)

## Running

```bash
cargo run --bin rust-post
```

## Directory Structure

- `src/main.rs` — egui dashboard
- `src/components/btc-chart/` — 3D chart component (launched as a process)

Looking at the existing architecture and thinking about what would make an truly impressive futuristic 3D trading platform, let me create a comprehensive plan:


Plan: Complete Futuristic 3D Trading Platform

Vision: "Blade Runner meets Bloomberg Terminal"
A fully immersive 3D trading environment where data flows around you in real-time, with holographic panels, particle effects, and gesture controls.


Core Components Overview

1. 3D Sidebar Panel System (Floating holographic panels)
Portfolio Sphere - Your holdings orbiting in 3D space
Order Book Walls - Buy/sell orders as towering green/red walls
Market Heatmap Grid - 3D grid of top cryptos with real-time color changes
Trade History Stream - Particle flow showing recent trades
News Feed Hologram - Scrolling holographic news ticker
Quick Trade Panel - Gesture-controlled buy/sell interface

2. Enhanced BTC Chart (Center stage)
✅ Already have 3D candlesticks with lighting
ADD: Technical indicators floating above chart
ADD: Volume bars beneath candles
ADD: Support/resistance planes
ADD: Fibonacci retracement levels in 3D

3. Immersive Effects System
Trade Particles - Buy/sell orders fly as glowing particles
Price Alert Holograms - 3D notifications that materialize
Ambient Grid - Tron-style floor grid with data pulses
Motion Trails - Price movements leave glowing trails
Bloom Effects - Glowing edges on active elements
Chromatic Aberration - Cyberpunk-style color shifts

4. Advanced Interaction System
Multi-touch Gestures - Pinch to zoom, two-finger rotate
Voice Commands - "Show Bitcoin", "Buy 0.1 BTC"
Eye Tracking Ready - Look at panels to focus
Haptic Feedback - Controller vibration on trades
AR/VR Mode - Switch to immersive view

5. Professional Trading Features
Multi-Timeframe View - 1m, 5m, 1h, 1d charts in carousel
Trading Bots Panel - 3D visualization of bot strategies
Risk Management HUD - P&L, exposure, margins
Market Scanner - Rotating sphere of opportunities
Social Sentiment - Twitter/Reddit sentiment as particle clouds

Detailed Implementation Plan

Phase 1: Core 3D UI Framework (2 hours)
Implement Holographic Panel System
```rust

pub struct HolographicPanel {

position: Vec3,

size: Vec2,

opacity: f32,

glow_intensity: f32,

content: PanelContent,

}

```


Create Sidebar Manager
6-8 floating panels arranged in arc around main view
Panels can be grabbed and repositioned
Auto-arrange mode vs manual placement
Panel minimize/maximize animations

Panel Types Implementation
Portfolio sphere with rotating assets
Order book with dynamic wall heights
Trade history as flowing particles
Market heatmap as 3D grid

Phase 2: Enhanced BTC Chart Integration (1 hour)
Integrate existing chart from `visualization/chart/`
Add technical indicators
Moving averages as glowing ribbons
RSI/MACD as floating gauges
Volume profile as 3D histogram

Multi-timeframe support
Carousel of charts at different intervals
Smooth transitions between timeframes

Phase 3: Effects & Polish (1.5 hours)
Particle Systems
Trade flow particles between order book and chart
Price alert explosions
Background ambience particles

Post-processing Pipeline
Bloom for glowing elements
Motion blur for smooth movement
Depth of field for focus effects
Chromatic aberration for cyberpunk feel

Audio Integration
Spatial audio for trades
Price movement sounds
Alert notifications
Ambient techno soundtrack

Phase 4: Advanced Features (1 hour)
Gesture Recognition
Swipe to change timeframes
Pinch to zoom chart
Draw to create trendlines
Air tap to execute trades

AI Trading Assistant
3D avatar that provides insights
Natural language processing
Trade recommendations visualization

Theme System
Matrix (green digital rain)
Tron (neon blues)
Cyberpunk (neon pinks/purples)
Minimalist (clean whites)
