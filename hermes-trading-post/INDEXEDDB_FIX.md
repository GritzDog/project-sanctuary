# IndexedDB Fix (No Fallback)

## The Problem

The browser console showed:
```
Failed to open IndexedDB: VersionError: The requested version (2) is less than the existing version (3)
```

This error was blocking ALL caching, causing the app to fail.

## The Proper Fix

1. **Incremented DB Version**: Changed `DB_VERSION = 4` to force schema upgrade
2. **Fixed Transaction Error**: Removed incorrect `await transaction.complete`
3. **Added Upgrade Logging**: Shows what's happening during schema migration
4. **Removed API Fallback**: Cache must work properly (as requested)

## How It Works Now

- Version 4 forces the `onupgradeneeded` handler to run
- Creates proper `chunks` and `metadata` stores
- No fallback - cache works or it doesn't
- Better logging shows upgrade progress

## Cache Management Tool

Open http://localhost:5173/clear-cache.html to:
- **Check Cache Status**: See version, stores, and record count
- **Clear Cache**: Empty all data but keep structure
- **Delete Database**: Remove entirely and start fresh

## If Still Having Issues

1. Use the cache management tool to delete the database
2. Reload the trading dashboard
3. Watch console for "Upgrading IndexedDB from version 3 to 4"
4. Cache should work properly after upgrade
