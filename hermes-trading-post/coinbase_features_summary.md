- ✅ Price label background changes color to match price movement

### 2. Chart Layout Adjustments
- ✅ Reserved 90 pixels on the right side for price label (`price_label_width`)
- ✅ Modified projection matrix to account for right margin
- ✅ Chart content properly scaled to fit within available space

### 3. Real-Time WebSocket Integration
- ✅ WebSocket price is displayed in dashboard header with color coding
- ✅ Current forming candle is updated in real-time from WebSocket data
- ✅ Price line updates on every tick for smooth real-time tracking

### 4. Timeline Display
- ✅ Timeline at bottom shows time labels (HH:MM format)
- ✅ Timeline auto-scrolls as new candles arrive
- ✅ Time labels properly spaced and centered

### 5. Performance & Rendering
- ✅ GPU-accelerated rendering maintaining ~28ms render times
- ✅ Proper text overlay compositing for price labels and timeline
- ✅ Separate rendering regions for chart content, timeline, and price label

## Technical Implementation Details

### Modified Files:
1. **linux_gpu_chart.py**:
   - Added `price_label_width = 90` for right margin
   - Updated `_create_projection_matrix()` to account for right margin
   - Enhanced `_draw_price_label()` with color-coded background
   - Updated `_get_frame_bytes()` to composite price label area

2. **dashboard.py**:
   - WebSocket integration for real-time price updates
   - Live price display in header with color changes
   - Current candle updates from WebSocket ticker data

### Key Code Changes:

```python
# Projection matrix adjustment for right margin
horizontal_scale = 2.0 / (right - left) * chart_width_ratio
horizontal_offset = -(right + left) / (right - left) - (1.0 - chart_width_ratio)

# Price label with dynamic colors
if self.current_price > self.prev_price:
    bg_color = (0, 100, 80)  # Teal background
    text_color = (200, 255, 200)  # Light green text
elif self.current_price < self.prev_price:
    bg_color = (100, 20, 20)  # Red background
    text_color = (255, 200, 200)  # Light red text
```

## Usage
The chart now provides a Coinbase-like trading experience with:
- Real-time price tracking with visual feedback
- Clear price display always visible on the right
- Smooth auto-scrolling timeline
