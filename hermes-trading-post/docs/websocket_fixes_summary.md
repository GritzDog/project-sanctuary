# WebSocket Integration Fixes Summary

## Issue
The WebSocket was connecting and receiving data, but the live price updates, current candle, and price line were not displaying in the chart.

## Root Cause
The `ThreadedGPURenderer` was not properly forwarding the `update_current_candle` method calls to the underlying chart instance. It was treating them as regular candle additions instead of updating the forming candle in-place.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added UPDATE_CURRENT_CANDLE Command
**File**: `components/chart_acceleration/threaded_gpu_renderer.py`
- Added `UPDATE_CURRENT_CANDLE = "update_current_candle"` to the `RenderCommand` enum
- This allows the GPU thread to handle current candle updates separately from regular candle additions

### 2. Fixed update_current_candle Method
**File**: `components/chart_acceleration/threaded_gpu_renderer.py`
- Changed from calling `update_data()` to sending a proper `UPDATE_CURRENT_CANDLE` command
- This ensures the current forming candle is updated in-place rather than added as a new candle

### 3. Added Handler for UPDATE_CURRENT_CANDLE
**File**: `components/chart_acceleration/threaded_gpu_renderer.py`
- Added handler in the GPU thread loop to process `UPDATE_CURRENT_CANDLE` commands
- Forwards the call to `chart_instance.update_current_candle()`

### 4. Enhanced Debug Logging
- Added logging to trace WebSocket data flow through the system
- Added print statements in critical methods to verify data is being processed

## Verification
The fixes were verified with a test script that confirms:
- `update_price()` is being called and updates the chart's current price
- `update_current_candle()` is being processed correctly
- The price line (`_draw_price_line`) is being rendered with the correct price

## Additional Features Working
- Live price display in dashboard header (already implemented)
- Timeline with time labels at bottom of chart
- Price label with color-coded background on the right
- Auto-scrolling as new candles are added
- WebSocket reconnection with exponential backoff

## Next Steps
The WebSocket integration is now fully functional. The chart will display:
- Historical candles from the REST API
- Live price updates from WebSocket
- Current forming candle that updates in real-time
- Dynamic price line that moves with the current price
- Price label on the right showing current price with color coding
