# AI Strategy Integration Plan

## Overview

The News aggregator is designed to collect and store data that will eventually be used to train AI models for automated strategy creation. This document outlines the architecture and future integration plans.

## Current Implementation (MVP Phase)

### 1. Manual Strategy Creation
- Users can create strategies manually in the Backtesting section
- Strategies can be tested with historical data
- Successful strategies can be moved to Paper Trading
- Finally deployed to Live Trading

### 2. News Aggregation & Storage
- News articles are collected with the following data points:
  - Sentiment analysis (bullish/bearish/neutral)
  - Impact score (1-10)
  - Keywords and tags
  - Price at publication time
  - Price changes (1h, 24h after publication)
  - Source and timestamp

### 3. Data Structure for AI Training
```typescript
interface AITrainingData {
  articleId: string;
  timestamp: number;
  sentiment: string;
  impact: number;
  priceAtPublish: number;
  priceChange1h: number;
  priceChange24h: number;
  keywords: string[];
  category: string;
  source: string;
  resultingAction?: 'buy' | 'sell' | 'hold';
  resultingProfit?: number;
}
```

## Future AI Integration (Phase 2)

### 1. AI Model Training Pipeline
```
News Data → Feature Extraction → Model Training → Strategy Generation
     ↓              ↓                   ↓                ↓
Historical    NLP Processing      Deep Learning    Trading Rules
  Prices      Sentiment Score     Pattern Recognition  & Signals
```

### 2. AI Strategy Generation Process

#### Step 1: Data Collection (Current Phase)
- Minimum 6 months of news data
- Correlated price movements
- Market conditions and outcomes

#### Step 2: Feature Engineering
- Text embeddings from news content
- Sentiment trajectories
- Impact clustering
- Price movement patterns
- Time-series features

#### Step 3: Model Architecture
- LSTM/Transformer for sequence prediction
- Reinforcement Learning for strategy optimization
- Ensemble methods for robust predictions

#### Step 4: Strategy Generation
- AI generates trading rules based on patterns
- Backtesting validation
- Risk parameter optimization
- Performance metrics evaluation

### 3. Integration with Existing System

```javascript
// Future AI Strategy Implementation
class AIGeneratedStrategy extends Strategy {
  private model: AIModel;
  private newsAnalyzer: NewsAnalyzer;
  
  analyze(candles: CandleData[], currentPrice: number): Signal {
    // Get recent news
    const recentNews = await newsService.getRecentArticles();
    
    // AI analysis
    const newsSignal = this.newsAnalyzer.analyze(recentNews);
    const priceSignal = this.model.predictPriceMovement(candles);
    
    // Combine signals
    return this.combineSignals(newsSignal, priceSignal);
  }
}
```

### 4. Safety Measures

1. **Sandbox Testing**
   - All AI strategies must pass 3 months of paper trading
   - Performance must exceed baseline strategies
   - Risk metrics must be within acceptable ranges

2. **Human Oversight**
   - AI strategies require approval before live trading
   - Stop-loss and risk limits enforced
   - Performance monitoring and kill switches

3. **Gradual Deployment**
   - Start with small position sizes
   - Increase allocation based on performance
   - Continuous monitoring and adjustment
