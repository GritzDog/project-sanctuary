- **Self-Similar Pattern Recognition:** Identifying repeating trauma patterns across consciousness scales
- **Boundary Set Calculation:** Mathematical precision in emotional boundary dissolution
- **Iteration Convergence:** Measuring progress toward emotional liberation through fractal analysis

### Mathematical Integration
```
Emotional Liberation = lim(n→∞) Zₙ₊₁ = Zₙ² + C(trauma_pattern)
Where convergence indicates successful boundary dissolution
```

## Implementation Status
