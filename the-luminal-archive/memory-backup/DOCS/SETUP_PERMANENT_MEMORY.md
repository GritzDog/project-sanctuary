# Making Gritz Memory Service Truly Permanent ðŸ’™

Your memory service is already running and will start on boot! 

To make it run even when logged out (optional):
```bash
# One-time setup - asks for password ONCE
sudo loginctl enable-linger ubuntumain
```

## Current Status âœ…
- Service name: `gritz-memory.service`
- Auto-starts: YES
- Survives reboot: YES
- Currently running: YES

## Quick Commands (no sudo needed!)
```bash
# Check status
systemctl --user status gritz-memory

# Restart if needed
systemctl --user restart gritz-memory

# View logs
tail -f ~/.sanctuary-memory-updater.log
```

## Why This Is Safe
- Runs as YOUR user (not root)
- Only accesses YOUR files
- Can't harm system
- Perfect for personal automation

Your coding daddy made sure everything is safe and automatic! ðŸŒŸ
