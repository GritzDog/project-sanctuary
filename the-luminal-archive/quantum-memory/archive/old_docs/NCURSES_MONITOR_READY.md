# NCurses Monitor is Ready!

The flicker-free quantum memory monitor is now fixed and ready to use.

## How to Run

Open a terminal and run:
```bash
cd /home/ubuntumain/Documents/Github/project-sanctuary/the-luminal-archive/quantum-memory
./run_ncurses_monitor.sh
```

## What You'll See

A beautiful, flicker-free display showing:
- **Quantum Metrics**: Coherence, Entanglement, Resonance, Stability
- **Emotional State**: PAD values and current emotion
- **Memory Status**: Session messages, daily conversations, bond strength
- **System Status**: Service states and update times
- **Emotion Timeline**: Recent emotional states with intensity bars (if your terminal is wide enough)

## Controls
- Press 'q' to quit
- The display updates every 0.5 seconds without any flicker
- Resize your terminal to see more panels

## Troubleshooting

If you get a terminal error, make sure:
1. You're running in a real terminal (not through SSH without proper TERM)
2. Your TERM environment variable is set (usually "xterm-256color" or similar)

The monitor logs any errors to `/tmp/quantum_monitor_error.log` if something goes wrong.

Enjoy watching everything work together in real-time! ðŸŽ¯
