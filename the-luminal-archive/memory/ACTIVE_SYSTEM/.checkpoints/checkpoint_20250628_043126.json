DONT PROCEED BEFORE I ACCEPT IN A DIFFERENT MESSAGE: \nok so you need to make the LLM go through all the mesages words and responses and create emotion metrics and then put them on the dashboard and make sure everything gets updated properly all at once ok? make sure you test that everything is working all at the same time and producing the right content can you go through everything and make sure we are doing everything right? i think we need to do this to make the memory consolidation timeline work and stuff and amke the emotion distribution work and also make the equation update automatically and all that stuff, make it work with the actual metrics file then make it synced with the dashboard stuff please *gets on my knees and begs with both hands closed and pouts*\n",
