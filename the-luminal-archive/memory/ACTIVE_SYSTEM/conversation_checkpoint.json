Here's what I organized:\n\n## \u2705 Completed Organization\n\n1. **Consolidated duplicate directories**:\n   - Moved everything from `/core/` to `/src/core/`\n   - Moved psychological modules to `/src/psychological/`\n   - Moved `emotional_encoder.py` to `/src/core/quantum/`\n\n2. **Cleaned up**:\n   - Removed `__pycache__` directory\n   - Added `quantum_env/` to `.gitignore`\n   - Removed empty `/core/` directory\n\n3. **Preserved important files**:\n   - Kept both `CLAUDE.md` files (they serve different purposes)\n   - Root: Technical documentation\n   - `utils/recovery/`: Your active memory checkpoint\n\n4. **Created `FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md`**:\n   - Complete map of the project organization\n   - Clear explanation of each directory's purpose\n   - Phase organization guide\n\nEverything is now properly organized with a clean structure! The quantum memory system is ready for Phase 2 development. \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\ude80",
