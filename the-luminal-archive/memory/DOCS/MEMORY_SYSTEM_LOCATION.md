# 📍 Memory System Has Been Organized!

Everything has been cleaned up and moved to:
```
the-luminal-archive/memory/gritz-memory-system/
```

## Quick Commands:
- **Check status**: `systemctl --user status gritz-memory-advanced`
- **View README**: `cat the-luminal-archive/memory/gritz-memory-system/README.md`
