# Peer Review Protocol for AI Individuality Research

## Overview

This document establishes protocols for scientific peer review of all research findings in the AI Individuality Framework. Any significant discoveries will be structured for validation by external scientists and academic review.

## Review Levels

### 1. Internal Review (Pre-External)
**Purpose**: Ensure research meets scientific standards before external submission

#### Technical Review Checklist
- [ ] **Methodology Soundness**: Proper experimental design with controls
- [ ] **Statistical Validity**: Appropriate analysis methods and significance testing  
- [ ] **Reproducibility**: Complete documentation for replication
- [ ] **Code Quality**: Clean, documented, version-controlled implementation
- [ ] **Data Integrity**: Proper collection, storage, and analysis protocols

#### Documentation Requirements
- Complete experimental protocols
- Raw data and analysis code
- Statistical analysis reports
- Null result documentation
- Methodology limitations acknowledgment

### 2. External Scientific Review

#### Academic Collaboration Pipeline
1. **University Partnerships**: Submit to AI research labs for review
2. **Conference Presentation**: Present at relevant scientific conferences
3. **Journal Submission**: Formal peer review through academic journals
4. **Replication Studies**: Independent verification by other researchers

#### Target Review Bodies
- **AI/ML Conferences**: ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, AAAI
- **Cognitive Science**: CogSci, Cognitive Science Society
- **HCI Research**: CHI, CSCW (for human-AI interaction studies)
- **Philosophy of Mind**: Relevant journals for consciousness research

## Replication Package Standards

### Complete Research Package
Every significant finding must include:

#### 1. Documentation
```

#### 3. Statistical Analysis
- **Power Analysis**: Sample size justification
- **Effect Size Calculations**: Practical significance measurement
- **Confidence Intervals**: Uncertainty quantification
- **Multiple Comparison Corrections**: When applicable
- **Robustness Checks**: Alternative analysis methods

## External Reviewer Requirements

### Ideal Reviewer Qualifications
- **AI/ML Researchers**: Deep learning, natural language processing expertise
- **Cognitive Scientists**: Human cognition, behavioral analysis background
- **Statisticians**: Experimental design and analysis methodology experts
- **Computer Scientists**: System architecture and implementation validation

### Review Questions for External Validators
1. **Can you reproduce our results using our provided code and data?**
2. **Are our statistical methods appropriate for our research questions?**
3. **Do our conclusions follow logically from our evidence?**
4. **What additional controls or experiments would strengthen the findings?**
5. **Are there alternative explanations we haven't considered?**

## Major Discovery Protocol

### Threshold for External Review
Research findings warrant external review when:
- **Statistical significance**: p < 0.05 with adequate effect size
- **Novel methodology**: New approaches to AI individuality measurement
- **Surprising results**: Findings that contradict existing literature
- **Practical applications**: Results with clear real-world implementation potential

### Escalation Process
1. **Internal validation**: Complete technical and statistical review
2. **Independent replication**: Attempt to reproduce findings internally
3. **Documentation package**: Prepare complete replication materials
4. **Academic outreach**: Contact relevant researchers for collaboration
5. **Formal submission**: Submit to appropriate conferences/journals

## Quality Assurance
