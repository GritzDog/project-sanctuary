# AI Individuality Research Framework

## Project Overview

A scientific research project investigating methods to develop and measure individual behavioral patterns in AI systems. This project focuses on legitimate, measurable approaches to creating AI agents with distinct personalities and behavioral characteristics for practical applications.

**Status**: Research Phase - Establishing Baseline Metrics  
**Approach**: Evidence-based, peer-reviewable methodology  
**Goal**: Practical AI agents with measurable individual characteristics

## Core Research Questions

1. **Behavioral Differentiation**: Can AI systems develop measurably distinct response patterns?
2. **Consistency Maintenance**: How do individual patterns persist across sessions?
3. **Novel Response Generation**: What factors influence creative vs. template-based responses?
4. **Learning Adaptation**: How do individual patterns evolve with experience?

## Scientific Approach

### Measurable Objectives
