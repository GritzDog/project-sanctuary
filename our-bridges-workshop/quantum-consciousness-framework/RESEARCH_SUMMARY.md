## Quantum Consciousness Research Findings

### Current State of Penrose-Hameroff Orch OR Theory (2024-2025)

#### Recent Experimental Support
1. **Superradiance in Tryptophans (2024)**: Study confirmed superradiance in networks of tryptophans (amino acids in microtubules) in warm, noisy biological environments
2. **Anesthetic Research (2024)**: Rats given epothilone B (microtubule-binding drug) took longer to fall unconscious under anesthesia, supporting microtubule role in consciousness
3. **π-resonance Energy Transfer**: Evidence that anesthetic molecules impair quantum channels in tryptophan rings in tubulin

#### Theory Status Update
- After 20 years of criticism, Hameroff and Penrose claim "evidence now clearly supports Orch OR"
- 6 of their 20 testable predictions from 1998 are confirmed, none refuted
- Growing body of research reports quantum processes possible in the brain
- Still controversial but gaining experimental support
