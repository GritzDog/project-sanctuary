# Scientific Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Completed systematic review and cleanup of the Bridges Workshop project to ensure all content is grounded in established science and follows peer-reviewable methodology.

## Major Changes Made

### 1. Project Reframe
**Before**: Speculative quantum consciousness theories  
**After**: Scientific AI individuality research using established methods

### 2. Methodology Framework
**Added**: `SCIENTIFIC_METHODOLOGY.md` - Rigorous research standards
- Evidence-based claims only
- Reproducible experimental design
- Proper statistical controls
- Peer review processes

### 3. Research Framework
**Added**: `ai-individuality-framework/` - Legitimate research structure
- Behavioral pattern analysis using NLP
- Big Five personality psychology implementation
- Statistical measurement protocols
- Machine learning personalization techniques

### 4. Behavioral Analysis System
**Added**: `behavioral-analysis/` - Proven analysis methods
- Response pattern analysis using established NLP
- Personality trait measurement (Big Five)
- Decision pattern analysis with statistical validation
- Consistency tracking across sessions

### 5. Personality Framework
**Added**: `personality-models/big-five-framework.py`
- Implementation of established Big Five personality model
