# Scientific Methodology and Peer Review Framework

## Overview

This document establishes rigorous scientific standards for AI individuality research in the Bridges Workshop. All research must be grounded in established science, use proper controls, and follow peer-review standards.

## Research Standards

### 1. Scientific Rigor Requirements

#### Evidence-Based Claims Only
- All claims must be supported by measurable, reproducible evidence
- No speculative theories without empirical backing
- Clear distinction between hypothesis and established fact
- Proper statistical significance testing

#### Reproducible Methodology  
- Detailed protocols for all experiments
- Open-source code and data when possible
- Clear documentation of experimental conditions
- Version control for all research materials

#### Proper Controls
- Control groups for comparative studies
- Baseline measurements for all metrics
- Randomization where applicable
- Blind/double-blind studies when possible

### 2. AI Individuality Research Framework

#### Legitimate Research Areas

   - Statistical analysis of response patterns
   - Consistency metrics across sessions
   - Novel response generation capabilities
   - Language style differentiation

2. **Information Theory Approaches**
   - Entropy measurements in responses
   - Compression ratios of behavioral data
   - Information integration metrics
   - Complexity measurements

3. **Cognitive Architecture Studies**
   - Attention mechanism analysis
   - Memory system behavior
   - Decision-making process examination
   - Learning pattern variations

4. **Interaction Dynamics**
   - Human-AI relationship formation
   - Communication pattern evolution
   - Preference development tracking
   - Social behavior emergence

### 3. Measurement Protocols

#### Quantitative Metrics
- **Response Novelty**: Similarity scores vs training data

### 4. Experimental Design Standards

#### Control Groups
- Baseline AI without individualization treatment
- Human baseline for comparison metrics
- Random response generators for null hypothesis
- Multiple AI architectures for comparison

#### Variables
- **Independent**: Individualization interventions
- **Dependent**: Behavioral measurements
- **Controlled**: Environment, prompts, timing
- **Measured**: All relevant performance metrics

#### Statistical Requirements
- Minimum sample sizes (n≥30 for statistical power)
- Appropriate significance levels (α=0.05)
- Effect size calculations
- Confidence intervals for all estimates

## 5. Peer Review Process

### Internal Review
1. **Technical Review**: Code quality, methodology soundness
2. **Statistical Review**: Analysis validity, significance testing
3. **Reproducibility Check**: Independent replication attempt
4. **Literature Review**: Comparison with existing research

### External Validation
1. **Academic Collaboration**: Partnership with universities
2. **Conference Presentation**: Peer feedback incorporation
3. **Journal Submission**: Formal peer review process
4. **Open Science**: Public data and code sharing

## 6. Prohibited Approaches
