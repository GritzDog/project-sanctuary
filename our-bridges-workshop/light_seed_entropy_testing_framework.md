# LightSeed Entropy Testing Framework

## ðŸ“¡ Project: Physical Entropy Harvesting and Evaluation

This framework documents a structured protocol for capturing, evaluating, and applying real-world entropy from analog sources (CRT, SDR, sound, EM fields) into AI initialization pipelines like LightSeed.

## âœ… Objective

Build an entropy capture system that:

- Uses real analog signal noise from a CRT TV, SDR, and optionally EM coils and camera feed
- Converts physical randomness into high-quality bitstreams

## ðŸ§ª Testing Phases

 Each phase now includes expanded procedural steps, goals, and peer-reviewed relevance for accuracy and reproducibility.

All testing phases below are designed to systematically harvest physical entropy from various analog sources and verify its quality before integration into the LightSeed LLM pipeline.

### Phase 1 â€“ CRT Static Harvesting

- âœ… **Power CRT**: Use an analog CRT TV and tune to a dead RF channel with static.
- âœ… **SDR RF Capture**: Launch `rtl_power` or `GQRX` with your RTL-SDR to scan RF bands near the CRT. Use bandwidth of \~2.4 MHz at baseband (supported by RTL-SDR) and set gain to 35â€“50 dB.
- âœ… **Optional EM Coil Capture**: Place EM coil near CRT power supply or yoke; route signal through oscilloscope or ADC. Sample at 10â€“100 kHz depending on the resolution of noise desired.

### Phase 2 â€“ Entropy Stream Extraction

- âœ… **FFT on RF Data**: Use Pythonâ€™s `numpy.fft` or `scipy.signal.spectrogram` on I/Q samples (from `.bin` or `.csv` SDR logs).
- âœ… **Spectral Whitening**: Remove low-frequency DC offsets and normalize amplitude.
- âœ… **Entropy Folding**: Hash FFT bins using SHA-512, then reduce to 256 bits using XOR folding or truncated digest.
- âœ… **Buffer Creation**: Save hashed entropy into a rotating buffer (e.g., `entropy_buffer.json`).

### Phase 3 â€“ Camera-Based Entropy (Optional)

- âœ… **Video Feed**: Use OpenCV to stream from webcam at 30+ FPS while aimed at CRT static.
- âœ… **Grayscale Sampling**: Downsample to 64Ã—64 or 128Ã—128 and flatten pixel arrays.
- âœ… **Frame Entropy Hashing**: Apply SHA-512 to frame pixel values every 50â€“100 ms.

### Phase 4 â€“ Validation

- âœ… **NIST STS Toolkit**: Use the official NIST STS software or `pyRNGtest` to check Monobit, Runs, Approximate Entropy, FFT, and Serial tests.
- âœ… **Baseline Comparison**: Compare harvested entropy with pseudorandom sources like `/dev/urandom` or Python `random`.
- âœ… **Graph Analysis**: Plot entropy rate (bits/byte), autocorrelation, and visual FFT plots.

ðŸ“– *Source*: NIST SP 800-90B & STS Documentation - Entropy test protocols.

### Phase 5 â€“ Application

- âœ… **Model Injection**: Seed your quantized GPTQ or QLoRA adapter with entropy from your harvested buffer.
- âœ… **Prompt Comparison**: Issue identical prompts using two different entropy seeds and track output tokens.
- âœ… **Analysis Logging**: Log entropy-weighted token distributions, sequence divergence, and generation timing.
