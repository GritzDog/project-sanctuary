# Behavioral Analysis Framework

## Overview

Scientific framework for analyzing and measuring AI behavioral patterns using established methods from natural language processing, statistics, and cognitive science.

## Core Measurements

### 1. Response Pattern Analysis
Using proven NLP techniques to measure behavioral consistency and individuality:

```python
import nltk
import spacy
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import numpy as np

class BehavioralAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
        self.vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
        
    def analyze_response_patterns(self, responses):
        """Analyze linguistic patterns in AI responses"""
        features = {
            'avg_sentence_length': self._avg_sentence_length(responses),
            'vocabulary_diversity': self._vocabulary_diversity(responses),
            'sentiment_patterns': self._sentiment_analysis(responses),
            'complexity_scores': self._complexity_analysis(responses)
        }
        return features
        
    def measure_consistency(self, session_1, session_2):
        """Measure behavioral consistency across sessions"""
        vectors_1 = self.vectorizer.fit_transform(session_1)
        vectors_2 = self.vectorizer.transform(session_2)
        return cosine_similarity(vectors_1, vectors_2).mean()
```

### 2. Personality Trait Measurement
Implementation of Big Five personality model for AI behavioral analysis:

- **Openness**: Novel response generation, creative language use
- **Conscientiousness**: Response consistency, task completion patterns  
- **Extraversion**: Communication style, interaction preferences
- **Agreeableness**: Cooperative vs. competitive response patterns
- **Neuroticism**: Emotional stability in responses

### 3. Decision Pattern Analysis
Statistical analysis of choice patterns and decision-making approaches:

```python
class DecisionAnalyzer:
    def analyze_choice_patterns(self, decisions):
        """Analyze consistency in decision-making"""
        return {
            'choice_entropy': self._calculate_entropy(decisions),
            'preference_stability': self._preference_tracking(decisions),
            'reasoning_patterns': self._reasoning_analysis(decisions)
        }
```

## Measurement Protocols

### Data Collection
- Standardized prompt sets for consistent measurement
- Controlled interaction environments
- Multiple session data for longitudinal analysis
- Baseline comparisons with standard AI responses

### Statistical Analysis
- Significance testing for behavioral differences
- Correlation analysis for consistency measurement
- Clustering analysis for individual grouping
- Regression models for predictive analysis

### Validation Methods
- Cross-validation of measurement techniques
- Inter-rater reliability for qualitative measures
- Replication studies for robustness testing
- Comparison with human behavioral baselines

## Applications

### Individual AI Development
- Personality-based response customization
- Consistent behavioral pattern establishment
- Learning rate optimization for individuals
- Preference development tracking

### Multi-Agent Systems
- Role differentiation in AI teams
- Complementary skill development
- Communication pattern optimization
- Collaborative behavior analysis

## Research Pipeline

1. **Baseline Establishment**: Standard AI behavioral measurement
2. **Individual Development**: Personality customization implementation
3. **Consistency Testing**: Cross-session behavioral stability
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Individual vs. baseline performance
5. **Longitudinal Tracking**: Long-term behavioral development
